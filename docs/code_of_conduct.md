# Code of Conduct
In a Code of Conduct you discuss with each other what you expect from each other and from collaboration. Everyone participates in this and supports the agreements that you draw up together. A Code of Conduct is a flexible document. If after some time it appears that certain agreements are not realistic or applicable, then it is important to discuss this in the group and adjust the agreements if necessary.

## Assignment description:
> In your own words, describe what you need to do as a group on this course.

We need to build a successful, working quiz game application that increases the players’ energy awareness. The application must be a client/server game using a Spring Boot REST API for the backend and an OpenJFX client application that can be played in both single-player and multi-player modes through a well-functioning graphical interface. The game has to include three different types of questions: multiple choice, estimation, and calculation questions. Data about the players needs to be stored in a relational database.

We must be able to present and explain our product as a team and ensure that everyone contributes to the different parts of the application. We also need to develop both as a group and to help each other develop as individuals to meet the learning goals that we have specified under the ambition section.

## Target or ambition level:
> What grade are you working for?

The course "Object Oriented Programming Project" provides us with a bunch of possibilities for learning new technologies, getting acquainted with working in a team and becoming more experienced in the field of software development. Our target in this course is to learn as much as possible by making the best use of the provided materials, the time spent on doing this course and the ability of working on a project as a group. We are going to learn a lot of different things, many of which will be useful in our future, professional (or academic) lives. Among others we will learn about different aspects of group work, collaboration, social skills, presentation skills, dealing with conflicts, resolving problems and meeting deadlines. We will also acquire a multitude of so-called hard skills, i.e. skills and abilities related directly to software development, requirements engineering, programming, software architecture, etc. We will get to know new technologies, such as Spring, JavaFX, Git, GitLab and many other useful libraries, frameworks and tools, which are indispensable in the world of Information Technology. In addition we will improve our Java programming skills and get more experience with using it in practice, creating a real-world application. Moreover, we will discover the best programming practices and learn how to apply them.

We will do all of these by working on a project with our team, building a functional quiz application in Java as described by our answer to the first question. Our goal is to make the application as good, functional, usable, aesthetic as possible and make it fulfill all the requirements proposed by the client (course staff). Furthermore, we aim at learning as much as possible by maximizing the usage of the best programming guidelines and practices, such as testing, static code analysis, thorough code review. We will definitely not focus only on the final product though! The process of creating it is equally important, so we will ensure that our teamwork and collaboration is as effective as possible, follows the best practices and lets us show our full potential in creating our application.

By doing all of these, we will learn a lot of very useful skills, gain the necessary knowledge and create a product that deserves the best grade. Specifically, we are aiming at a grade of minimum 8.0 but we are also definitely open to having a higher grade.

## Products:
> What should you deliver at the end? On which platform do you share which documents (Discourse/Miro/MS Teams)? What standards must the work submitted meet?

We should deliver the source code of the working application such that it can be built and run by a client. The code will be in GitLab, together with the documents relevant to both the process and the final application. We will be using continuous integration throughout the project and running pipelines each time new code is merged. The standards that we must meet include:
- adhering to the Checkstyle rules for code that we decide on as a group
- having your code reviewed by at least two or more teammates before it is merged and preferably having at least two or three comments on each submitted piece of code
- ensuring that the code is functional and fully tested with the appropriate methods such as dependency injection using a mock test object - this includes a certain minimum percentage of test coverage (e.g. 70 percent). In addition, the person who reviews the code will also review that it has been adequately tested and is not missing, for example, a significant edge case or input.
- for submissions other than code, for example the agenda and the minutes of meetings, the standard is upheld by consensus. The agenda is viewed by everyone in the team and points are added to it by discussion, while the minutes are also reviewed before they are uploaded. In the case where such a document is of an insufficient standard, we will request the team member working on it to improve it and give them appropriate feedback so that this can be done.

## Planning:
> How do you ensure that each group finishes everything on time? Did you clarify who will have a final say in the final deliverable and submit it to Brightspace on behalf of the project group?

We meet every week to make sure that everyone is aware of the deadlines of the week and submits them on time. We upload the relevant deliverables on GitLab and everyone submits the same document from GitLab to Brightspace if it is needed. The person responsible for the upload will be the person who creates the source document (on Git or Google docs) and is primarily working on it.

We try to let everyone work on every aspect. This includes the backend and frontend - we will not have a division with half the team working on each half, but rather we will all work in different smaller parts of both backend and frontend. However, when a task seems very small, we assign it to 2 or 3 people so they can work faster and more efficiently. We begin with dividing the work over everyone before we start coding.

In terms of deadlines, we set our interim deadlines on the date two days before the official deadline for the deliverable. By this we give ourselves a safe margin to review the work and finalize it before it is uploaded.

## Behavior:
> How do you treat each other in the group? How do you handle disagreements within your group? Could your guide or student assistant be involved in reaching consent? What do you do if someone is late during a group meeting?

We base our working activity on mutual trust and professionalism. The key factors of our core product are based on coordination (each one of us will adjust their respective actions to the other member’s ones), negotiation (discussions in order to reach a general agreement), persuasion (trying to reach out to others in order to make them understand that our respective ideas may be more adequate to our collective goal as opposed to theirs, without making them feel that they miss out on the key aspects of our domain), and social perceptiveness (in the way that we are aware of our teammate’s reactions and trying to respond to their respective concerns).

As for disagreements, when they occur, we try to thoroughly understand why that person feels like the general idea is not that ingenious, or that it does not correspond to the general plan, and why debate as to what has to be done (or calling out a vote, but that should be a last resort), trying to reach a compromise. If that still cannot be achieved, we head out to our TA in order to reach a satisfying deal, in the way every part gets the most possible out of the respective situation. To be more specific, if some disagreement arises, we need to deeply analyze what each part suggests as being the best choice. If some sort of compromise can be easily reached, we pursue with the given format. Otherwise, we need to find a way to all choose a side and try to convince each other which should be our direction. If this still cannot be reached, the TA, as the last resort, should be the instance that at most gives us a suggestion as to what we can do. After that, we, as a team, make the choice. That should be the strategy to follow when disagreement may arise, but it is not to say that intermediate steps, for example small group discussions, cannot be enough to resolve conflict.

As to what we will do if someone is late for a meeting, we wait for them for 10 minutes at the start of the meeting and if we still can’t contact them, we do not mind and start working right ahead. In time, as we have seen in the individual assignments, this is the harshest, but most effective tactic in order to deal with someone being late.

## Communication:
> In what ways do you communicate with each other as a group and among yourselves? (In the studio/MS Teams/Miro/Discourse)

We use Mattermost for official communication with the TA for timely feedback and to see if there’s any necessary adjustment. Unofficially, we communicate through WhatsApp to schedule meetings outside of the weekly mandatory meeting with the TA and share our work progress. It is also used to inform other people when something temporary happens.

To make sure everyone is on track and solve problems together quickly, we try to organize face-to-face meetings on campus as much as we can, and if needed we use Zoom or Google meetings to link with a person who cannot attend so they don’t get left behind. We have a general list in advance for discussion content to ensure the efficiency of the communication. When all things are done for a meeting, we will arrange a new time slot according to everyone’s schedule.

## Commitment:
> How do you determine the quality of each group's work, so that each group delivers the same quality?
How do you measure the commitment of the chairs and minute takers?

We determine the quality of everyone’s work by making comments and conducting code reviews individually throughout the development process and by going over major finished chunks of work that is about to be submitted with the whole group during our physical meetings to ensure that the quality is sufficient and that there are no unfulfilled requirements. We could also make one member of the group specifically responsible for conducting in-depth quality checks of the group’s work every week.

We define quality in accordance with our ambition level described in an earlier section. We want to ensure first and foremost that our work will be submitted before the deadline, pass the assignment and that no requirements are left unfulfilled, but as we’re aiming for a grade of at least 8.0, we set the bar for quality work higher than that. Specifically, we want the test coverage of our server-side code to be at least 70%, and for items that are scored based on the flag system, we want our flag to be green rather than yellow whenever possible.

The chairs’ and the minute takers’ commitment is seen through the documents they submit, i.e. the agenda and the minutes of the meeting. Every team member checks the quality of the chairman’s agenda by suggesting changes through leaving comments on GitLab if needed before approving it. We check the quality of the secretary’s notes by letting him/her know during our physical meetings whether everyone was able to clearly understand the notes and whether anyone thought something was missing. We seek to give thorough feedback to the chairman and the secretary in these meetings both when the quality of work was high and when something was missing, and in the case problems arise we seek to improve through having a constructive group discussion about what the secretary or the chairman could have done better.

## Meetings:
> How often will you meet as a group? What preparation is needed for the meetings?

As a team that has been active for almost 2 weeks, we try to pursue unity and commitment. It is fundamental to our success as a team to always be up to what happens within our team. That is why we have to be in touch throughout this whole journey, both personally and as a whole group, to be sure that we can put ourselves in someone else’s shoes and to be able to work effectively, especially when we have to work in smaller groups (see for example when some of us have to work on backend and others on frontend). That is why we have unanimously agreed on meeting regularly, in order to solve and elucidate the problems that we will inevitably face during this course. We meet once during the TA meeting, where we have a present agenda put up by the chair and the TA, and we go through the key points that concern our project. The second meeting that we hold is somewhere during the week, generally on Thursday, when we work on those issues that we discussed during the TA meeting. As to what we have to prepare for those meetings, we have to be up to date with everything that concerns our collective project, but especially the working sector where we reside (frontend, backend). We have to complete all of our assignments and have a thorough understanding of how our piece that fits in the collective work. Also, it is fundamental that we talk to our front-end/back-end partners to make sure that we are on the same wavelength, to coordinate the whole work into one single functional, efficient and responsive product.

## Decision-making:
> How do you make decisions? By majority vote or by consensus?

In the best case, we try to make decisions by consensus whenever we can, and if it appears impossible, we try to reach a decision through a majority vote.

Our target is to find a result which is supported by all of us. If there is a tie or a non-landslide vote, we will discuss the decision further to seek the best solution for our group’s common interests. We give priority to the main idea but we don’t want to force members to agree but rather persuade them to agree through discussion. If the minority is very determined and refuses to compromise, we can first listen to their voice and list our basis separately, striving to find common ground while reserving differences.

We will try to avoid serious disagreements during the meetings and respect every one’s ideas. When the discussion finally comes to an impasse, asking TA for advice will be a way to do it. TA’s suggestion will have an important impact on us, but that doesn’t mean it’s bound to be the decisive vote. We can take it as our main reference and try to adjust the plan properly, having a final decision.

## Dealing with conflicts:
> How do you handle conflicts within the group?

Our general approach to dealing with conflicts which may arise in our team during the work on the project is that in case of such a conflict we should always start with having a discussion about the matters we do not agree on. In the discussion the opposing sides should try to explain their points of view. It is important because the conflict might have arisen just because of lack of mutual understanding. By talking about it we may come to a conclusion that there is nothing to argue about or if it is not the case, one of the sides may draw the attention to some important points the other side did not think about. Possibly we can finish this conflict in a peaceful way.

If after having a discussion we are still unable to reach an agreement, we may need to use other ways of conflict resolution, such as voting. If the voting is decisive, the side that did not win will need to accept this fact and comply with the will of the majority. In case of a tie, we can discuss and vote again or ask for an opinion of someone more experienced.

In rare cases, when we are unable to resolve the conflict ourselves we may seek the help of the TA, but in general we should try to deal with disagreements internally without bringing it up to any higher instances. Coping with problems on our own and being tolerant is a very important skill, that is why we should do it whenever possible.

We need to remember that conflicts are natural and inevitable. Therefore we should develop a set of behaviours that allows us to deal with conflicts in effective and peaceful ways. We should aim at calming the conflict, not exacerbating it. We should always listen to each other. We should also separate the problem from the person.

Another rule of utmost importance is that we always respect each others' opinions and treat everyone with respect. This is something we should always remember about but it is even more important during conflicts and discussions as it is much easier to be disrespectful to other people if we disagree with their point of view. We cannot allow such behavior.

## Guidance:
> What do you expect from the teacher's and/or student assistant’s guidance? What do you want feedback on, on the content or on the collaboration?

We would like to receive feedback on both the content and the collaboration. In terms of collaboration, we expect that the TA will facilitate a discussion of what each individual member contributed every week and give us a warning when there is an unequal division of tasks between members. Along with this, we hope that in the unlikely case of a serious conflict the TA will give their guidance - especially if it concerns a technical aspect of the project. We do not expect the TA to give us a specific judgment in such a case, but rather provide tips or extra knowledge that could help us make a specific technical decision. We would also like to have more general feedback on our working style and tips to improve weaknesses in our team.

This also connects to receiving feedback on the content. We expect that our TA will give us feedback in accordance with the rubric of each required deliverable and that this will be done in a continuous manner (for example, once in the draft stage and later at an improved or finished stage) so that we can take the feedback into account and improve on our work. Through this the TA helps keep us on track with the rubric and schedule of the individual assignments. In the larger scope, we also expect that we will be given a warning if we are falling behind on the project schedule so that we can work to catch up.

## Consequences:
> What are the consequences if a participant in the group does not keep to the agreements?

We try, as individuals, to all contribute equitably to the project itself. If someone does not keep their agreement, we try to get to a solution as a group. We will try and help that person if he or she just does not know what to do. However, if this seems to happen more often we have a conversation with the TA. We will never punish someone if their work is not done properly or in time. If he/she does not get to finish their job before the deadline, there will be a new deadline which is 24h after the first deadline. This should still work with the official deadline, since we set our own internal deadlines 48h before the official submission. Because of this there is still time for that person to get their work done. If this happens more often we will discuss this within the group and try to come up with a solution.

## SuccessFactors:
> What makes your team a dream team?

We aim for everyone to have a positive experience with the project and be satisfied with our work as a team and development as individuals at the end. We have a diverse range of  individuals with different skills in the team who all want to help each other improve throughout the project. Naturally, we’re also all highly motivated to deliver a successful product in the end. We aim for every person to recognise their strengths and weaknesses through this project, develop more confidence in their strengths and improve on their weaknesses.

Our highest motivation is to give our work our best effort so that at the end we are satisfied with what we have put in and gained from the project. We would like to feel that we have all learned something and had a meaningful experience. We consider the actual product secondary to this goal, but naturally we believe that putting in our best efforts will automatically produce the best resulting product that we can deliver. This motivation is what makes our team a dream team.
