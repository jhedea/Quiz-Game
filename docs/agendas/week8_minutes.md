## Opening

## Approval of the agenda
- Quick look up through the agenda items, see if there is anything missing.

## Short Reflection
- How did this week go? What has each one of us done over the last period of time? What is not working?
    - Recap of everyone's merge requests from this week

## Team's report on status of the development
- Information about the status of the development from the perspective of the team:
  - All must haves are basically completed, intermediate leaderboard and the timer still require some bug fixes
  - Jokers, emojis, question generation and score calculation improvements and design improvements for next week

## TA's feedback on team's progress
Information about the status of the development from the perspective of the TA:
- Would have been better if all merge requests had been merged before the meeting
- When time runs out in multiplayer, a player who doesn't answer should also be showed the correct answer
- It's good that most of the items on the sprint were done during the week
- Work distribution is getting better
- Some methods on the backend seem to have too high cyclomatic complexity
- Test coverage looks fine, just update the code of conduct to indicate that we're aiming for 70% server test coverage, rather than for 70% total test coverage

## Action points for next week
- Keep working on could haves and should haves
- Recommended work distribution: Rauno and Karol on the frontend, Sucharitha and Ioan wherever needed, Ye on the backend
- Start working on the final presentation
  - Will take place on Thursday, 14th of April at 3.45 pm or later
  - Just a Q&A - the video is for our own presentation of the project
  - Will be 20 minutes at maximum
- The video is important - should go over the whole application
  - The intended audience of the video is the client - no technical backend details needed. However, if a technical detail makes the game more efficient or sth, talk about that. Faces visible - recommended to do in Zoom.
  - Submit the video to the TA by week 9 Tuesday to get feedback. If the video isn't ready, we can do it in person.
  - Graded based on the content rather than the presentation style
  - Video length is probably about 10 minutes, to be confirmed later
- Assignment 5B - due April 1st
  - Important to do properly before the deadline - there's no repair assignment
- Final Buddycheck due in week 9
- Final repository due on week 9 Friday

## Additional points or questions
- Time to discuss any additional points that were not included in the agenda.

## Questions for the TA
- Any remaining questions for the TA, including additional comments or questions from the TA to the group.

## Feedback
