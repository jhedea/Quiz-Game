## Must have
- The user must be able to play a functioning quiz game containing twenty questions (provide answers and see their score).  This is the basic functionality of the product.  The user must be able to play this using a graphical interface that contains text.
- The questions will be of three types - comparing the energy consumption of different tasks, estimating the energy consumption of a certain task, or equating how many times a certain task can be done for the same amount of energy as another task. Multiple choice questions will have three options.
- The user must be able to enter a username before they begin the game. This username will be used to register them on the leaderboard.
- The user must be able to see a leaderboard containing the ten top scores of all-time scored by single-player games.
- The user drops out of the game and their progress is lost (both in single and multi-player games) if the user’s connection to the server is lost.
- The user should be given a time limit within which they must answer the question (best in 15-20s).
- The user should be able to play a multi-player game, with a functional waiting room such that any player in the waiting room can start the game.
- The users within a multi-player game play in a synchronized manner, with the questions being shown to everyone at the same time.

## Should have
- The users within a multi-player game should be able to see an intermediate leaderboard after every five questions in a game.
- The users should be given pictures that illustrate the tasks described in the question.
- The user should be able to score more points if they answer a question faster.
- The users are able to use Jokers in the game. Each player is given three Jokers (Eliminate one option, shorten time for other players, double points).
- The “eliminate option” should only be applicable for multiple-choice questions
- The “Shorten time” should only be available for multi-player games.
- A player can use each Joker once in a game, after which it is unavailable.
- The user within a multi-player game is alerted if their chosen username is already in use by another person in the waiting room - they are asked to change to a different name.
- The user could be able to react to questions with an emoji (out of a provided set of emojis in the game).

## Could have
- The user who is playing as a multi-player should be able to start a game from the waiting room only if there are a minimum of two players in the waiting room.
- The user is able to select their preferred area for questions (such as transport, education).
- The user will see who answered the question correctly (or the number of correct answers given).
- Multiple jokers can be used in the same question by a single user.
