## How to run it

### Prerequisites
- Windows or Linux operating system (may work on other systems, but we do not guarantee)
- Java 17 (with JavaFX) installed on the device
- Git installed on the device
- access to this Gitlab repository

### Steps for running the server
1. Clone this repository on your local machine.
```
git clone git@gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl:cse1105/2021-2022/team-repositories/oopp-group-22/repository-template.git
```

2. Download the Activity Bank artifact with all activities. You can find more information about it in `importer/README.md` document.
In the rest of this document it is assumed that the activities are downloaded into a directory called `activities`,
located next to the cloned repository directory. The `activities` folder should contain directories from `00` to `78`
and file `activities.json`, according to the Activity Bank format.

3. Enter the cloned repository directory.
```
cd repository-template
```

4. Run the server using Gradle.
```
./gradlew :server:run
```

5. Import activities from the Activity Bank. You can find more details about it in `importer/README.md` document.
```
./gradlew :importer:run --args "http://localhost:8080 ../../activities -D"
```

### Steps for running the client
1. Clone this repository on your local machine (skip if already done).
```
git clone git@gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl:cse1105/2021-2022/team-repositories/oopp-group-22/repository-template.git
```

2. Enter the cloned repository directory.
```
cd repository-template
```

3. Run the client using Gradle.
```
./gradlew :client:run
```

4. After the application opens, click `Use default` to connect to the local server
(localhost:8080, the server must be running) or enter IP address (along with port number) of another server.
